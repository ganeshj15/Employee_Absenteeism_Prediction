# Employee_Absenteeism_Prediction
Machine Learning Model to predict a employee will be excessively absent or not.

In this project, I made model which will predict absenteeism of employee from various features. Here datset to be worked is in "Absenteeism_data.csv.". Firstly I made some preprocessing on this datset and all the preprocsseing you can find in "absentism_preprocessed.ipynb" file. SO you can start with this file firstly.Preprocessed data in this file is exported to "Absenteeism_preprocessed.csv".
Then this preprocessedn data is used further for part of machine learning.Here I used Logistic Regression Classfier, since target is in terms of binarylike excessive absent or not.
You can find the file named "Absenteeism_Logistic_Regression.ipynb" where all the machie learning part is done. I also made some versions of this file like, by reducing some of the features & logistic regression without implementing standardaization of the data.
So you may refer these files also.
